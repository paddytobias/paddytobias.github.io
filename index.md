<b>Education & Training</b></p>
<li>I coordinated Intersect's training program at Deakin, delivering the programming, data science and data management courses on campus. A colleague and I deliver all the training at Deakin. We delivered +40 courses in 2019.</li>
<li>I worked to improve the experience of participants inside and outside of the courses, building up a network of interested researchers and systematically notifying them when courses become available. I have found that this has built a community of researchers interested in upskilling, which has facilitated peer-to-peer learning.</li>
<li>I regularly presented to HDRs, post-doctoral fellows and academics on data and software management techniques, eResearch capabilities, and help researchers in their projects through consultation and advice.</li>

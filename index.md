## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi! I am the eResearch Analyst employed by Intersect Australia, based at Deakin University, Melbourne.

I moved to Armidale from Melbourne in 2010 for PhD in the inter-disciplinary field of peace and conflict studies. My PhD focused on the [socio-cultural impacts of democratisation in Timor-Leste](https://osf.io/fmsnh/).

I have recently finished writing a new course for <a href="https://intersectaustralia.github.io/training/QLTRICS101/">teaching the survey tool, Qualtrics</a>, with input from the Sydney-based Qualtrics office, as well as <a href="https://github.com/paddytobias/research-software-management">research software management</a>.</li>

<li>This year is my second year sitting on the organising committee for <a href="https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/sydney/">Sydney ResBaz</a>. At last year's event I was the lead instructor for the <a href="https://paddytobias.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz-syd-intro-r/"><em>Introductory R stream</em></a>, coordinating three other trainers as well.</li>

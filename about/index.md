## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="../photo.jpg">

I am the data science manager at the Social Research Centre. I am passionate about deploying data science in a research context. 

My academic research training is in Sociology, Political Science and International Relations, with a particular focus on Peace and Conflict Studies. Whilst my research background is somewhat unusual for my current role as an eResearch Analyst, I bring a number of years of academic and industry research and engagement experience.

Since taking on this role a couple of years ago, I have been learning computational methods and languages including R, SQL, and  Python. I am particularly interested in the possibilities that advanced computational techniques and database solutions bring to the Arts and Humanities research areas in the form of natural language processing, and as such have began a Masters of Data Science.

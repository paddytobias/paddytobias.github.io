## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="../photo.jpg">


I am the data science manager and technical lead at the Social Research Centre. I am passionate about deploying and scaling up data science solutions in a research context. I have worked on a wide range of research projects from bush fire resilience to higher education student outcomes.

I have taken a slightly unusual path into this space. My original academic training is in political science and community development (with a PhD focused on the [socio-cultural impacts of democratisation in Timor-Leste](https://osf.io/fmsnh/)), however since 2015 I have become increasingly immersed in the large-scale data world, captivated by the possibilities of fast-changing data technologies.

You can find many of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/paddytobias)

## From my colleagues...

*Thoughtful, deliberative, strategic, balanced.  He brings a combination of IT maturity, level headedness, hard work, and strong communication skills that are very hard to find.  He listens well, develops appropriate solutions that consider the current situation, the big picture connections, and the future. That’s strong leadership.* - Diane Herz, SRC's Chief Executive Officer, 2022.

*Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support you have given me in co-leading the Data Science Group. I couldn’t have done it without you!* - Cynthia Kim, SRC's Senior Director of Data Science, 2022.

*Paddy keeps the team productive, in a way that kind of hold the team members accountable- “don’t feel like you’re doing enough work? Talk to Paddy!”. I like his approach of casually catching up with the team members, ask how we’re doing and what we’re working on and trying to find ways to upskill the members of the team... Paddy is also big on innovation, keeping up with the latest technology- always finding ways to improve our processes and workflows, providing lots of useful functions and package products. A reliable manager all in all.* - SRC colleague, 2023.

*Paddy is passionate about developing better technical processes and capabilities in SRC – he thinks outside the box but remains realistic about goals and expectations. I think this is a very valuable combination!* - SRC colleague, 2023.
